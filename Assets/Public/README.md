Adds Discord Rich Presence functionality to Risk of Rain 2.

## Features
- Displays the current stage's icon, name, and subtitle, the currently selected difficulty, the currently selected character, and the current run time.
- Has a unique presence for different menu states (currently idling in the menu, choosing a character, and reading the logbook).
- Allows invitation of users via Discord.

A plethora of options are provided to fine-tune the presence settings, such as whether or not to show the currently fought boss, the teleporter charge status, include a custom menu idle message, and more.
